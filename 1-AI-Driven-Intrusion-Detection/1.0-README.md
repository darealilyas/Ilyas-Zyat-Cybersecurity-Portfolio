# Enhancing Cybersecurity Threat Detection in AI-Powered Intrusion Detection Systems Using Adversarial Penetration Testing

## Overview

The primary aim of this project was to enhance cybersecurity threat detection in AI-powered Intrusion Detection Systems using adversarial penetration testing. The work focuses on experimentally evaluating how effective AI-based IDS models are when exposed to realistic penetration testing activity, identifying potential weaknesses against adversarial manipulation, and exploring approaches to improve detection resilience.

The project investigates how modern intrusion detection can combine traditional signature-based monitoring with machine-learning approaches. Instead of relying solely on theoretical datasets, realistic attack traffic was generated in a controlled lab environment to observe how detection systems behave under conditions closer to real enterprise networks.

The goal was not only to build an AI-supported IDS model, but to understand how these systems perform when confronted with practical attack scenarios, how they compare to traditional rule-based IDS solutions, and where improvements can be made to increase reliability in operational environments.

### Objectives

- Review traditional intrusion detection approaches alongside AI-based IDS research, with emphasis on adversarial machine learning and penetration testing implications  
- Analyse the CIC-IDS2017 dataset as a baseline for training and evaluating machine-learning intrusion detection performance  
- Develop an AI-based IDS using a Random Forest model trained on extracted network features  
- Design and configure a controlled lab environment integrating tools such as Kali Linux, Snort, Wireshark, Metasploit, and Jupyter Notebook  
- Generate realistic adversarial network traffic through penetration testing activities including scanning, exploitation attempts, and abnormal traffic patterns  
- Evaluate detection performance using metrics such as precision and accuracy across normal and malicious traffic conditions  
- Assess susceptibility of the detection model to evasion techniques through adversarial testing scenarios  
- Improve detection reliability through defensive strategies such as retraining and ensemble-based Random Forest approaches  
- Compare AI-driven intrusion detection performance with traditional signature-based IDS monitoring to identify strengths and limitations  
- Draw practical conclusions and propose recommendations for improving deployment of AI-based IDS solutions in cybersecurity environments

## Methodology

### Research Approach

The project adopted a practical evaluation approach combining controlled penetration testing with intrusion detection analysis. Instead of relying exclusively on pre-existing datasets, adversarial traffic was generated within a dedicated lab environment to replicate realistic attack patterns.

A hybrid IDS model was considered where:

- Signature-based detection provided baseline monitoring of known attack indicators
- Machine-learning classification analysed traffic flows for behavioural anomalies
- Comparative analysis assessed strengths and weaknesses of each approach

This allowed observation of detection performance under both expected and unpredictable traffic conditions.

### Requirements, Design & Implementation

The design focused on creating a controlled yet realistic environment suitable for detection testing:

- A segregated virtual lab network ensured safe testing without affecting production systems
- Network traffic was intentionally mixed with benign and malicious activity to simulate realistic operational noise
- Detection components were configured to monitor traffic continuously for both rule-based and ML analysis
- Emphasis was placed on observation, interpretation, and evaluation rather than exploitation impact

The implementation aimed to replicate practical detection workflows used in enterprise monitoring environments.

## Lab Setup

A dedicated virtual lab environment was created to safely simulate attack traffic and detection processes.

- Attacker environment: Kali Linux system used to generate controlled adversarial traffic
- Target environment: Ubuntu-based system monitored by IDS components
- Detection environment: Hybrid intrusion detection setup combining signature-based monitoring and ML evaluation
- Network isolation ensured all testing remained contained within a controlled environment
- Packet capture and monitoring tools were used to observe traffic behaviour and IDS responses

This setup allowed realistic testing of intrusion detection capabilities while maintaining ethical and safe experimental conditions.
