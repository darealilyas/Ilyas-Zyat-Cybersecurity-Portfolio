## Overview

Following the adversarial penetration testing phase, network traffic generated during the attacks was monitored using a signature-based intrusion detection system. The objective of this stage was to observe how traditional IDS monitoring reacts to realistic attack activity and to capture packet-level evidence for further analysis.

Rather than relying solely on predefined datasets, this phase uses traffic produced directly from controlled penetration testing activities. This provides realistic network behaviour, enabling more reliable evaluation of intrusion detection performance and preparing structured data for subsequent machine learning analysis.

The combination of IDS alert monitoring and packet capture ensures that both detection outputs and raw network evidence are available for analysis, bridging the gap between adversarial testing and AI-based intrusion detection evaluation.

## Detection and Traffic

### IDS Deployment

Snort was deployed within the isolated virtual lab environment as a network intrusion detection system positioned to monitor communication between the Kali Linux attacker machine and the Ubuntu target system. This configuration ensured visibility over reconnaissance scans, brute-force attempts, denial-of-service activity, enumeration behaviour, and exploitation preparation traffic.

This setup replicates a typical enterprise monitoring scenario where IDS sensors analyse internal network traffic to identify malicious behaviour.

---

### Packet Capture

During each attack execution, packet captures were generated alongside IDS alerts. These packet capture files provide raw network evidence that complements Snort signature alerts.

Packet capture serves multiple purposes:

- Verification that attacks were executed as intended  
- Detailed inspection of network traffic characteristics  
- Preparation of structured data for machine learning analysis  

Wireshark was used to inspect captured packets, validate attack patterns, and correlate them with IDS alerts.

### Alert Generation

Snort generated alerts corresponding to several attack categories observed during penetration testing:

- Reconnaissance scans triggered port scanning and probing signatures  
- Brute-force authentication attempts produced repeated login-related alerts  
- Denial-of-service activity generated abnormal traffic and flooding alerts  
- Directory enumeration and HTTP interaction generated web-related signatures  
- Exploitation preparation traffic produced service discovery and probing alerts  

These alerts demonstrate how signature-based intrusion detection identifies known attack behaviours while providing labelled traffic data for further behavioural analysis.

### Traffic Analysis

Wireshark analysis provided packet-level validation of IDS alerts and allowed closer inspection of attack characteristics:

- Scanning patterns showed structured probing behaviour across services  
- Authentication attacks displayed repeated connection attempts  
- Flooding activity showed elevated packet rates and abnormal traffic patterns  
- Web enumeration generated identifiable HTTP request sequences  

This manual inspection ensures the reliability of captured traffic and supports accurate feature extraction for machine learning intrusion detection evaluation.

## Discussion

### Detection Relevance

Signature-based IDS monitoring remains essential for identifying known attack patterns and providing immediate visibility into suspicious network activity. Snort alerts serve as both operational detection indicators and labelled data sources for behavioural analysis.

This phase validates the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection while supporting comparison with AI-based detection methods.

---

### Observed Limitations

Despite effective signature detection, several limitations were observed:

- Detection depends heavily on predefined rules  
- Novel or modified attacks may evade signature-based detection  
- Some alerts require contextual analysis to confirm malicious intent  
- Behavioural anomalies are not always captured by static signatures  

These limitations justify the integration of machine-learning approaches to complement traditional intrusion detection.

### Data Preparation for ML Classification

Captured packet data and IDS alerts were used to prepare structured datasets for machine learning analysis. Traffic captured during adversarial testing provides realistic behavioural patterns suitable for training and evaluating the Random Forest intrusion detection model. This stage links adversarial penetration testing with AI-based intrusion detection evaluation. By combining realistic attack traffic, signature-based detection outputs, and packet-level evidence, the project establishes a strong foundation for analysing the effectiveness of AI-supported intrusion detection systems.
