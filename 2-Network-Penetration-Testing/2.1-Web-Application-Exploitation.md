# Web Application Penetration Testing

## Context

This project involved a practical security assessment of the web application `Joblet.lk`, previously affected by a data breach. The objective was to evaluate the application from an attacker’s perspective, identify weaknesses across the web stack, and understand how multiple vulnerabilities could be chained together to compromise sensitive data.

Testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment and focused on realistic attack scenarios including reconnaissance, web enumeration, injection attacks, and database compromise.

---

## Reconnaissance and Attack Surface

Initial reconnaissance focused on identifying exposed directories, server technologies, and publicly accessible resources that could reveal entry points.

### Directory Enumeration

Directory brute-forcing identified several accessible paths that were not intended for public exposure. The `robots.txt` file revealed hidden directories, while directory indexing exposed configuration files and administrative interfaces.

</p>

Key observations:

- Hidden directories referenced in robots.txt
- Configuration files accessible via direct URL
- Recruiter login interfaces publicly exposed
- Directory indexing enabled on some paths

---

### Enumeration

Further scanning identified outdated server technologies and configuration weaknesses.

Tools used:

- Nmap for service discovery
- WhatWeb for technology fingerprinting
- Nikto for web vulnerability scanning

Key findings:

- Apache 2.2.22 detected (outdated)
- PHP 5.4.6 detected (outdated)
- Server banners exposed system details
- Security headers missing or misconfigured

Outdated software versions increase exploitability and simplify attacker targeting.

## Authentication Bypass and Database Compromise

The most critical findings emerged during authentication testing and database analysis.

### SQL Injection Exploitation

Login functionality was vulnerable to SQL injection. Using SQLmap, it was possible to:

- Confirm injection points
- Enumerate database schemas
- Extract sensitive data

Key findings:

- Backend MySQL database exposed
- Multiple sensitive tables accessible
- User credentials and personal data visible

This demonstrates how insufficient input validation can lead directly to data exposure.

---

## File Inclusion Vulnerability

Testing also revealed a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

By manipulating URL parameters, it was possible to retrieve sensitive system files such as:

- `/etc/passwd`
- Application source code files

Payload techniques included directory traversal and encoded input filters.

## Compromise Path Summary

The attack path followed a realistic progression:

1. Reconnaissance revealed hidden resources and outdated software
2. Directory enumeration exposed configuration files
3. Credentials were obtained from accessible files
4. SQL injection enabled database enumeration
5. Database access confirmed sensitive data exposure
6. File inclusion vulnerability provided additional system visibility

This demonstrates how multiple moderate vulnerabilities can combine into a critical compromise.

---

## Security Impact

The assessment highlighted several significant risks:

- Exposure of sensitive personal and organisational data
- Potential full database compromise
- Increased risk of privilege escalation
- Service disruption possibilities
- Weak input validation across the application

From a security standpoint, this represents a high-risk environment.

---

## Defensive Recommendations

Key mitigation steps include:

- Updating outdated server software
- Removing exposed configuration files
- Implementing prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Disabling directory indexing
- Securing database credential storage
- Implementing proper input validation
- Strengthening HTTP security headers

Addressing these issues would significantly reduce attack surface.

## Ethical Considerations

All testing was conducted within a controlled academic environment.  
No real organisation or production system was targeted.  
The purpose of this assessment was educational and focused on improving cybersecurity awareness and defensive practices.
