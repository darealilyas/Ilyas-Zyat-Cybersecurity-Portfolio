# Financial Institution Threat Scenario Analysis

## Overview

This project explores how a financial institution could be exposed to external cyber threats from a threat intelligence perspective. Rather than analysing a real incident, the objective was to assess potential risks proactively using publicly available intelligence sources, OSINT techniques, and structured threat modelling approaches.

The goal was to identify how attackers could target financial organisations through phishing infrastructure, exposed services, credential reuse, or social engineering, and to evaluate how monitoring solutions such as SIEM platforms could support early detection and mitigation before incidents escalate.

This exercise reflects a preventative cybersecurity mindset focused on threat awareness rather than incident response.

## Threat Exposure Assessment

### Key Potential Risks for Financial Institutions

| Threat Vector | Description | Security Impact |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Phishing / Executive Impersonation | Fake domains or social engineering targeting executives | Credential compromise risk |
| Exposed Infrastructure | Publicly accessible services or open ports | Potential attack entry points |
| Credential Exposure | Leaked credentials reused across services | Account takeover risk |
| Device Loss Scenario | Unsecured corporate devices | Insider-style threat exposure |

These risks were explored theoretically using OSINT tools to simulate how attackers could gather intelligence prior to launching attacks.

## MITRE ATT&CK Threat Mapping

The potential attack surface was mapped against MITRE ATT&CK techniques to better understand how a financial institution could realistically be targeted. This helps structure defensive planning and anticipate attacker behaviour.

| Threat Vector | Description | Example Risk |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Reconnaissance | Spear Phishing via Service | Domain impersonation targeting banking staff |
| Initial Access | Spear Phishing Link | Credential harvesting through fake banking portal |
| Execution | User Execution via Malicious File | Financial workstation compromise |
| Privilege Escalation | Domain Accounts | Compromise of internal financial systems |
| Credential Access | Exploitation for Credential Access | Banking application credential leakage |
| Impact | Financial Theft | Unauthorized financial transactions or fraud |

This mapping helps organisations anticipate attacker workflows and align defensive strategies accordingly.

## Role of SIEM in Financial Security

This project did not involve SIEM deployment but examined how SIEM platforms could support financial institutions from a monitoring and detection standpoint.

SIEM solutions enable:

- Centralised log aggregation across infrastructure  
- Event correlation to identify coordinated threats  
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activity  
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements  

These capabilities are critical in financial environments where fraud detection, regulatory compliance, and data protection are priorities.

## SIEM Platform Comparison

| Feature | Splunk | IBM QRadar |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Deployment Flexibility | High | Moderate |
| Built-in Threat Intelligence | Moderate | Strong |
| Customisation | Extensive | Structured |
| Ease of Deployment | More complex | Faster setup |
| Cost Predictability | Variable | More predictable |

This comparison highlights how different SIEM platforms could support a financial organisation depending on operational needs and resources.

## Implementation Considerations (Theoretical)

For a fictional financial institution, SIEM implementation would typically involve:

### Data Sources

- Firewall and network security logs  
- Identity and authentication systems  
- Endpoint detection tools  
- Banking applications  
- Cloud infrastructure telemetry  

### Challenges to Anticipate

- Alert fatigue due to large log volumes  
- Integration complexity across systems  
- Skilled personnel requirements  
- Cost considerations  

Planning and phased deployment strategies are essential for effective SIEM adoption.

---

## Recommendations

From a threat intelligence perspective, financial institutions should prioritise:

- Strong email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Multi-factor authentication enforcement  
- Continuous monitoring for impersonation domains  
- Secure device management policies  
- Exposure scanning for public infrastructure  
- Centralised monitoring through SIEM solutions  

These measures reduce both technical and human attack surfaces.

## Key Takeaway

This exercise demonstrates how proactive threat intelligence, OSINT analysis, and structured threat modelling can help financial institutions anticipate cyber risks before incidents occur.

Combining external threat awareness with internal monitoring capabilities provides a stronger defensive posture in high-value sectors such as finance.
