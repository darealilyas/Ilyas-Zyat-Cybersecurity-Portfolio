## Overview

This project focuses on automating basic threat intelligence enrichment to support faster security analysis and prioritisation. The objective was to demonstrate how publicly available intelligence sources can be integrated into lightweight scripts to assess potential risk indicators before deeper investigation.

Two complementary workflows were developed:

- IP reputation scoring using VirusTotal
- Domain exposure analysis using Shodan

---

## 1. VirusTotal Suspicious Rate

The purpose of this component was to evaluate how suspicious specific IP addresses are by analysing how many security engines flag them as malicious or suspicious. This provides a simple but practical risk prioritisation metric.

### Method

- A list of IP addresses was imported from an Excel dataset
- Each IP was queried through the VirusTotal API
- The number of malicious and suspicious detections was extracted
- A Suspicious Rate (S.R.) was calculated using:

  **S.R. = (malicious detections + suspicious detections) / total engines**

This metric helps quickly identify which indicators deserve further investigation.

## 2. Shodan Analysis

This second component focuses on identifying whether domains are visible in Shodan and extracting infrastructure exposure information such as associated domain names, indexed services, and open ports.

### Method

- Domain names were imported from an Excel dataset
- The Shodan API was queried for each domain
- Information extracted included:
  - Whether the domain is indexed
  - Associated IP address
  - Open ports and observable services
- Results were displayed in a structured output table for quick analysis

## Threat Intelligence Investigations

These enrichment scripts can be reused after OSINT discovery activities. For example, domains, IPs, or infrastructure elements identified through intelligence mapping (such as Maltego investigations) can be quickly analysed using these tools to prioritise potential threats.

---

## Limitations

- Results depend on external intelligence provider coverage and API access limits
- Suspicious scores indicate potential risk but do not confirm malicious activity
- These tools support prioritisation rather than full incident attribution
