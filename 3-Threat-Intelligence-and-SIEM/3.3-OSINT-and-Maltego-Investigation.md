## Overview

This project focuses on an OSINT investigation conducted using Maltego to analyse the publicly visible infrastructure of the domain **maltego.com**. The objective was to map relationships between DNS records, IP addresses, subdomains, email contacts, hosting providers, and organisational entities using available Maltego transforms.

## Investigation Methodology

### Maltego Graph Mapping

The investigation began with a domain-based Maltego graph targeting **maltego.com**. Multiple transforms were applied to extract:

- DNS names and subdomains  
- Associated IP addresses and netblocks  
- WHOIS records and email contacts  
- Hosting providers and geographic locations  
- Organisational ownership information  

This produced a visual infrastructure map showing how different digital assets are interconnected.

### Infrastructure Breakdown

#### Domain, Subdomain, and Email Relationships

Further inspection of the graph revealed several DNS names and subdomains associated with the platform, indicating segmented services such as support, web services, and communication infrastructure.

The WHOIS transforms identified the email **support@maltego.com**, linking administrative contact information directly to the domain.

#### IP Infrastructure and Hosting Analysis

IP address transforms revealed hosting infrastructure largely associated with major cloud providers such as Microsoft. This suggests reliance on established third-party hosting services.

While this improves availability and reliability, it may introduce:

- Dependency on external providers  
- Potential shared infrastructure exposure  
- Centralised hosting risks

Geolocation transforms also helped identify where services are hosted, useful for infrastructure tracking and forensic analysis.

## Intelligence Enrichment Using Automation Tools

### VirusTotal IP Analysis

IP addresses extracted from the Maltego graph were analysed using the previously developed VirusTotal suspicious-rate automation script.

The results indicated that most IPs had no significant malicious detections. One IP address (185.199.108.153) showed a low suspicious rate flagged by two antivirus engines, suggesting minimal immediate concern but worth monitoring.

### Shodan Exposure Analysis

Domain names and subdomains identified in the Maltego graph were analysed using a Shodan automation script to assess infrastructure exposure.

The analysis revealed several open ports and publicly visible services. While not necessarily vulnerable, such exposure can increase the potential attack surface if services are outdated or misconfigured.

## Key Findings

- Multiple DNS names and subdomains indicate segmented service infrastructure  
- Hosting relies on major cloud providers, improving reliability but introducing dependency risks  
- Administrative email exposure could enable phishing or social engineering attempts  
- Infrastructure geolocation visibility can support attacker reconnaissance  
- WHOIS and organisational entity mapping provide insight into infrastructure ownership  

---

## Risks Identified

- Public subdomain visibility increases potential attack surface  
- Email exposure may enable phishing or spoofing attacks  
- Shared hosting infrastructure may create indirect risk if neighbouring systems are compromised  
- WHOIS/netblock information may assist social engineering or domain targeting  
- Concentrated geographic hosting could introduce resilience risks  

---

## Mitigation Recommendations

- Continuous subdomain monitoring using OSINT tools  
- Strong email authentication enforcement (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Infrastructure segmentation and isolation where possible  
- WHOIS privacy protection and regular auditing  
- Geographic distribution of services across providers
