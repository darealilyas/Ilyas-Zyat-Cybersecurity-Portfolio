## Overview

This project involved the forensic analysis of a disk image acquired from a Windows-based system.  
The objective was to apply structured forensic techniques to identify artefacts, understand system activity, and demonstrate competency in handling digital evidence in a controlled environment.

## Methodology

The investigation followed standard digital forensic procedures:

- Verification of forensic image integrity using cryptographic hashes  
- Examination of registry artefacts to identify system configuration and user activity  
- File system analysis including deleted file recovery  
- Software artefact identification through installed program inspection  
- Internet activity reconstruction through browser artefacts  
- Cross-validation of extracted evidence using multiple forensic tools  

Primary tools used included:

- Autopsy (disk image analysis)  
- Registry Viewer (registry artefact interpretation)  
- Hash verification utilities  

## Forensic Interpretation Approach

Rather than focusing on conclusions, this project emphasized:

- Understanding how digital artefacts reflect user behaviour  
- Identifying potential indicators of suspicious activity  
- Practicing evidence handling and interpretation methodology  
- Applying structured documentation practices typical of forensic reporting
