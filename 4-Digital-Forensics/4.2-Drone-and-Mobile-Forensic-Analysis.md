## Overview

This investigation focused on forensic analysis of drone telemetry data and associated storage media.  
The goal was to demonstrate the ability to extract, interpret, and contextualize data from embedded systems and IoT-style devices.

## Methodology

The forensic process included:

- Extraction of flight log data from drone controller storage  
- Analysis of telemetry data including GPS coordinates, altitude, and speed  
- Media file recovery from drone storage  
- Metadata examination to understand recording conditions  
- Visualization of flight paths using specialized analysis platforms  

Tools involved:

- Autopsy (storage artefact extraction)  
- PhantomHelp flight log viewer  
- AirData UAV analysis platform  
- Media metadata inspection utilities  

## Forensic Interpretation Approach

This project demonstrates:

- Handling non-traditional forensic evidence sources  
- Interpreting telemetry data within investigative contexts  
- Understanding how embedded devices generate evidentiary artefacts  
- Applying forensic reasoning beyond conventional computer systems
