## Overview

This project demonstrates practical malware analysis methodology through the examination of a Windows executable in a controlled environment. A legitimate installer executable was intentionally used as a safe substitute to focus on analytical workflow rather than risk exposure.

## Analysis Method

### Static Analysis

Initial triage focused on understanding the executable structure without execution.  
This included profiling the file type, reviewing imported API functions, and identifying indicators that typically help analysts assess potential risk.

Rather than attempting deep reverse engineering, the emphasis was on practical triage skills commonly used in security operations, such as:

- recognising installer packaging formats
- identifying system API usage patterns
- understanding how executable metadata supports threat assessment

### Dynamic Analysis

The executable was executed within a sandboxed environment to observe runtime behaviour safely.  
This stage focuses on behavioural indicators rather than file structure.

Typical observation points included:

- process execution behaviour
- file system interactions
- registry activity
- antivirus detection responses

The goal was not to classify malware but to practice behavioural interpretation techniques used in incident response and malware triage workflows.

## Analytical Perspective

Static and dynamic analysis serve complementary purposes:

- Static analysis helps identify structural characteristics and potential intent
- Dynamic analysis validates how software behaves under execution
- Combining both improves confidence in assessment and reduces false assumptions

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Safe handling of executable samples using isolated environments
- Static executable triage using industry analysis tools
- Behavioural observation through sandbox execution
- Interpretation of detection outputs without over-reliance on automated results
- Structured documentation aligned with professional cybersecurity reporting
