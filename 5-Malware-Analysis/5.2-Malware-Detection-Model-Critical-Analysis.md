## Overview

This project focuses on understanding how modern malware detection systems operate, particularly sandbox-based behavioural detection approaches.  
Rather than developing a detection model, the objective was to critically analyse how automated malware detection works, how results should be interpreted, and where limitations exist in real-world cybersecurity operations.

## Detection Model

### Sandbox-Based Detection

Modern malware detection increasingly relies on behavioural sandboxing rather than purely signature-based scanning.  
Executing a file in an isolated environment allows analysts to observe runtime behaviour such as process activity, network interaction, registry changes, and file system modifications.

---

### Detection Integration

Detection platforms typically combine multiple components to improve reliability:

- behavioural sandbox environments for runtime analysis  
- signature-based detection engines for known threats  
- rule-based monitoring using tools such as YARA or Suricata  
- memory analysis capabilities for deeper inspection  

---

## Critical Evaluation

### Strengths

Behavioural detection provides visibility into how software behaves rather than relying solely on known threat signatures.  
This increases detection capability for emerging or modified threats and supports deeper investigation workflows.

---

### Limitations

Automated detection systems are not definitive decision-makers.  
Common challenges include:

- sandbox evasion techniques used by advanced malware  
- resource-intensive analysis environments  
- false positives triggered by legitimate software behaviour  

---

## Practical Demonstration

### False Positive

To explore detection sensitivity, a legitimate installer executable was intentionally analysed within a sandbox environment.  
The aim was not to classify malware, but to understand how behavioural monitoring systems respond to normal software activity.

### Detection Interpretation

This exercise reinforced the importance of contextual analysis:

- legitimate applications can trigger behavioural alerts  
- automated scoring requires analyst verification  
- detection output should inform investigation rather than replace judgement  

---

## Detection Perspective

Effective malware detection typically relies on layered approaches combining:

- static analysis  
- behavioural monitoring  
- threat intelligence correlation  
- human analytical oversight  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Understanding of behavioural malware detection workflows  
- Interpretation of sandbox analysis outputs  
- Awareness of false positive dynamics in detection systems  
- Critical evaluation of automated cybersecurity tools  
- Ability to document analytical findings clearly for security contexts
