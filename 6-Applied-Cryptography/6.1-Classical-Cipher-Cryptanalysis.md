# Classical Cipher Analysis and Decryption

## Overview

This project demonstrates classical cryptographic analysis through the manual decryption of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.  
The objective was to apply fundamental cryptographic reasoning, frequency analysis, and contextual linguistic interpretation to recover an encrypted English text.

## Analysis Methodology

### Frequency Analysis

The initial step involved analysing ciphertext letter distribution using CrypTool 2.1.  
Frequency analysis allowed identification of likely substitutions by comparing ciphertext letter occurrence with known English language frequency patterns.

### Pattern Recognition

After initial frequency mapping, further progress relied on recognising:

- common English words and articles  
- punctuation patterns  
- grammatical structure  
- contextual vocabulary

### Python-Assisted Decryption

A small Python script was developed to automate substitution testing.  
The script allowed dynamic updates of the substitution map and provided immediate decrypted output previews.

## Analytical Perspective

This project illustrates how classical ciphers can often be broken through:

- statistical analysis  
- contextual reasoning  
- iterative hypothesis testing  
- structured documentation of substitutions
