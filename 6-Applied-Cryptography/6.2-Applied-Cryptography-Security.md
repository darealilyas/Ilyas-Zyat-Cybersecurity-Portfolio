## Overview

This project explores how cryptography is applied in practical cybersecurity scenarios rather than theoretical contexts.  
The focus is on how confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and secure credential handling are implemented in real operational environments. The objective was to analyse common security situations where cryptography plays a critical role and demonstrate awareness of secure implementation approaches.

## Use Case 1: Protecting Confidential Reports

Organisations frequently need to protect sensitive reports during storage and transmission.  
This requires both strong encryption for confidentiality and secure key management practices to prevent unauthorised access.

### Cryptographic Approach

A hybrid encryption model provides a practical balance between Symmetric encryption (AES) ensures efficient bulk data protection, and Asymmetric encryption (RSA) secures the encryption key during transmission.

The following are the OpenSSL hybrid encryption commands (AES encryption + RSA key protection)

-	Step 1: Generate AES key:

`openssl rand -out aes_key.bin 32`

- Step 2: Encrypt the report with AES-256:

`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in forensic_report.xyz -out report.enc -pass file:./aes_key.bin`

-	Step 3: Encrypt the AES key with RSA public key:

`openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey client_public.pem -pubin -in aes_key.bin -out aes_key.enc`

-	Step 4: Send report.enc + aes_key.enc to the client.

## Use Case 2: File Integrity Verification

Ensuring that files have not been altered is critical for software distribution, digital evidence handling, and secure communications.

### Cryptographic Approach

Hash functions provide integrity verification, using examples like MD5 which is vulnerable to collision attacks, and modern hashes such as SHA-256 offer significantly stronger integrity assurance.

-	Step 1: Hash the object file with SHA-256:

```
import hashlib
with open('object_file.bin', 'rb') as f:
    file_data = f.read()`
    hash_digest = hashlib.sha256(file_data).hexdigest()`
print(hash_digest)
```

-	Step 2: Share the hash value with the client separately.

-	Step 3: Client rehashes the received file and checks if the hash matches.

## Use Case 3: Secure Email Authentication

Email spoofing and impersonation attacks remain common cybersecurity threats.  
Authenticating message origin and ensuring message integrity are essential for organisational communication security.

### Cryptographic Approach

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) supports email authentication through:

- Digital signatures  
- Certificate-based identity verification  
- Encrypted communication channels

## Use Case 4: Secure Password Storage

Password compromise remains a major entry point for cyberattacks.  
Proper password storage mechanisms are essential to reduce risk even in the event of data breaches.

### Cryptographic Approach

Modern password hashing strategies include:

- Salted hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks  
- Memory-hard algorithms such as Argon2  
- Additional security layers like multi-factor authentication  

This next pratical example follows a Python Argon2 password hashing and verification code:

-	Step1: Install argon2-cffi in Python:

`pip install argon2-cffi`

-	Step2: Hash a password:

```
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher()
hashed_password = ph.hash("EmployeePassword123!")
print(hashed_password)
```

-	Step3: Verify a password during login:

```
try:   
ph.verify(hashed_password, "EmployeePassword123!")
    print("Password is correct")
except:
    print("Password is incorrect")
```

## Security Recommendations

From these use cases, several practical cybersecurity recommendations emerge:

- Use hybrid encryption for secure data transmission  
- Apply strong modern hashing algorithms for integrity verification  
- Implement certificate-based authentication for sensitive communications  
- Store passwords using memory-hard hashing algorithms with salting  
- Combine cryptographic controls with broader security measures such as monitoring and access control
