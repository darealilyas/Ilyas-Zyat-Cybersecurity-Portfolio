## Portfolio

This cybersecurity portfolio showcases applied tasks and projects completed during my MSc in Cybersecurity and related practical coursework. The work presented here reflects hands-on experience across multiple security domains, with a strong emphasis on understanding how security controls, detection mechanisms, and investigative processes operate in realistic scenarios.

Through these projects, I have developed practical knowledge in:

- Programming and scripting for cybersecurity tasks, including automation and analysis
- Security frameworks, controls, and concepts that inform enterprise security operations
- Intrusion detection systems and traffic-based detection techniques
- Packet capture, network traffic analysis, and attack behaviour interpretation
- Threat intelligence collection, enrichment, and correlation
- Digital forensics and evidence-based investigation
- Malware analysis and evaluation of detection models

Collectively, these projects demonstrate foundational skills and technical readiness aligned with entry-level roles such as:

- Cybersecurity Analyst
- Security Analyst
- SOC Analyst
- Information Security Analyst
- IT Security Analyst
- Cyber Defense Analyst
